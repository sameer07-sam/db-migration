# Migration Summary Report

## Overview

Migrated data from MySQL (`mysql_db`, table: `users`) to PostgreSQL (`postgres_db`, table: `users`).

## Migration Steps

1. Created schema and sample data in MySQL.
2. Created schema in PostgreSQL.
3. Used Python script to transfer data row-by-row.

## Data Integrity Checks

- Row counts are matched before and after migration.
- All primary keys and columns verified.
- Manual checks performed using SQL queries.

## Issues and Recommendations

- No issues found for this simple table.
- For more complex migrations (foreign keys, different data types), further mapping is needed.
- Use automated tools like [pgloader](https://pgloader.io/) for large-scale migrations.

## Result

Migration completed successfully. All data from MySQL was present in PostgreSQL after migration.
